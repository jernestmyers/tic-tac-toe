## Project 2 in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum

this is the first project to practice implementing factory functions, module patterns, and IIFEs.

features:
1. one player mode versus a computer that randomly generates a move
2. two player mode
3. DOM manipulation for inputting names; if left blank, players are called "anonymous"
4. users can choose "play again?" to continue game without necessitating name inputs
5. user can choose "change settings" if desiring to change number of players or name inputs

features to come:
1. unbeatable computer mode making use of a minimax algorithm

known issues:
1. code breaks if two-player mode is selected && if only playerX or playerO is given a value before clicking the gameBoard
